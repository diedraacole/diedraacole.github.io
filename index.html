      Hi, I'm Diedra, but you can call me Dee!

      <!-- REQUIRED: PARAGRAPH -->
      <p>
        I'm a <abbr title="Graphic Information Technology">GIT</abbr> undergrad at <abbr title="Arizona State University">ASU</abbr> Online studying Web Design and Development. My passion for web design started <q>a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away</q> when I learned basic <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> via Google to make myself and my friends <em>super cool</em> Myspace profiles.<br>Real original, eh?
      <br><br>
        Years later, I decided, "hey, that was a lot of fun&mdash;let's do that for a living!", and here I am, in the beginning of my senior year, taking as many courses and coding bootcamps as time allows to become the best designer I can be!

      <!-- REQUIRED: STRONG TEXT W/IN PARAGRAPH  -->
      <p>
        When it comes to the web, I'm a sucker for good design, but something that really warms my heart and is <strong>extremely important</strong> to me is good <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> design. I hope to become a strong, well-rounded web designer and developer that advocates for inclusive, accessible, and clean design for all users!

        Personal Life
      </h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not slinging coffee at Starbucks, you can most likely find me falling down the rabbit hole of my latest obsession whether that's binging a new video game or tv series, reading a Sci-Fi/Fantasy book (like one of the many Stephen King novels I thrifted from Goodwill but haven't read yet), learning to play a new song on my keyboard until my arms give out, or buying too many houseplants (thanks quarantine). 
        <br><br>
        When I'm not being a complete hermit, I enjoy traveling to visit friends that live out-of-state as well as traveling to see my favorite bands live. I also take part in recording a <abbr title="Dungeons & Dragons">D&amp;D</abbr> podcast that I co-host with my husband and four of our friends. Recently, I have been learning new coding languages with my husband as a way of challenging ourselves and spending time together whilst also pursuing our educational and professional goals.
